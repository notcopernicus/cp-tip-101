''' Instructor Demo:

Given a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a category and a value.
Write a function to count how many items belind to each category

UMPIRE

I believe that this problem is asking me to count exactly the quantity

The plan is to loop through the list and add the # of times seen
'''

items = [("fruits", "apple"), ("vegetable", "carrot"), ("fruits", "bannana")]

def count_by_category (items):
        pass
        
        # create initial directory
        category = {}

        for i, _ in items:
            print(i)
            category[i] = category.get(i, 0) + 1
        return category


results = count_by_category(items)
print(results)

votes = {votes}
# record a vote for a canidate using the function, map each canida
cast_vote(votes, candidate):
